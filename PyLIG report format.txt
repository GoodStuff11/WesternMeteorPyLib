Jacchia fit

Beginning:
- latitude
- longitude
- height
- range

Ending:
- latitude
- longitude
- height
- range


Notes:
- "meas1" and "meas2" are given input points.
- X, Y, Z are ECEF positions of projected lines of sight on the radiant line.
- Latitude (deg), Longitude (deg), Height (m) are WGS84 coordinates of each point on the radiant line.
- Jacchia (1955) equation fit was done on the lag (length minus the line fitted on the first 25% of the length)
- Right ascension and declination in the table below are given in the epoch of date for the corresponding JD, per every point.
- "RA and Dec obs" are the right ascension and declination calculated from the observed values, while the "RA and Dec line" are coordinates of the lines of sight projected on the fitted radiant line. "Azim and alt line" are thus corresponding azimuthal coordinates.
